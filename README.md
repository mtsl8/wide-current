psuedo-scripts and documentation to install a simple but complete (and secure) [artix](https://artixlinux.org/) [linux](https://www.kernel.org/) system onto a hard drive

current iteration is several markdown and shell files which document the installation process from hardware to desktop, the choices involved and steps required.

note: this is a work in progress. new features are being added as time and resources allow.
___

the core system is designed to be modern and fully functional while minimizing bloat and cruft, thereby gaining security and performance ~  software leverage on existing hardware. it is also designed to be easy to update, and to stay aligned with upstream whenever possible. package managers can resolve dependencies, but they don't understand the subtleties of system design in the fourth dimension.

additionally, there will soon be docs to assist with installing office and utility software, web browsers and email client, obs-studio (with streamelements/browser integration), everything needed to launch fabric modded minecraft, and other open source tools for image, video, and audio processing. 

(an attempt at making a complicated digital ecosystem easier for humans to manage, without taking away freedom)
