psuedo-scripts to install a simple but complete (and secure) [artix](https://artixlinux.org/) [linux](https://www.kernel.org/) system onto a HDD

note: this is a work in progress. new features are being added as time and resources allow.

current iteration is a few text files which document which packages in which order and which configuration files and other relevant actions need to be taken (, in what order..). this is not _exactly_ tested in that I installed on one comuter and typed on the other. should work for nvidia gpus 10** and up. (ps. I don't recommend nvidia but yeah it's cheap and available so..)

\[package managers can resolve dependencies, but they don't understand the subtleties of system design\]

the core system is designed to be modern and fully functional while minimizing bloat and cruft, thereby gaining security and performance ~  software leverage on existing hardware. it is also designed to be easy to update, and to stay aligned with upstream whenever possible.

additionally, there will soon be docs to assist in with office and utility software, web browsers and email client, obs-studio (with streamelements/browser integration), everything needed to launch fabric modded minecraft, and other open source tools for image, video, and audio processing.
