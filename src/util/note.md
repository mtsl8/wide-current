functions to be used for parsing yaml configuration files into bash variables;

will be used to transform choices into configuration variables, 

allowing how-to's to be transformed into scripts;

allowing for reduced squinting and time loss.

in the future, front-end menu systems will be built for the configuration files,

so that eventually the process can be executed in an entirely graphical environment if desired,

yet still easily modifiable and useable by source / text for relevant situations.
